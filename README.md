# INTRODUCTION

Hello and welcome to my Investment Calculator repo.  This project is built with React as part of a React course by Maximillian Schwarzmüller.

This demo project is an investment calculator where the user can enter some data about their planned investment.  For example, current savings, the amount to add every year, the expected return on investment and the timeframe for this investment. The app aims to calculate the interest the user will gain from these investments. It renders a table with the results for a calculation where the user can see year by year how much interest they're going to gain.
